          <p>The process of scientific publishing has a long history dating back to 1665. With the idea of peer reviewing
submitted manuscripts in 1831, one sought to increase the quality of publications, and thus to sort out
inferior submissions before publication. Until this day, the peer review process has been deeply manifested in
the publishing process. Traditional and established publishers benefit from the peer review process, which
is provided free of charge by individuals out of the research community. The current state of peer review
raises concerns about quality, fairness and costs related to publishing. While open access publication enables
global access to research papers without subscription fees, it still fails a fair review process. Peer reviewing
is an essential part of scientific publication to validate and evaluate scientific work. However, reviewers
are not compensated neither monetary nor in a form of gaining reputation for qualitative reviews. In this
thesis we are proposing a decentralized platform for peer reviewing conference or journal submissions. By
using distributed technologies like the Blockchain technology and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS)
we provide a transparent review process, a reputation option for reviewers and the characteristics of open
accessible publications.</p>
